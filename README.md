# Bee Movie Code Adaptation

A fun, creative project that brings the Bee Movie to life through object-oriented Python code. Rather than a simple line-by-line transcription of the movie, this is a reimagining of the Bee Movie's world as a living, breathing software system.

## What is This?

This project takes the characters, plot, and themes from the Bee Movie and recreates them as Python classes. The goal is to explore how you'd architect the bee hive, Bee City's economy, and the relationships between characters if you were building it as a software system.

Instead of printing dialogue, we're building **class structures** that model:

- Characters as objects with properties and behaviors
- Relationships and interactions between bees, humans, and the hive
- The hive's hierarchy and work systems
- The comedic chaos of the Bee Movie's premise through code logic

## Project Structure

- **main.py** - Core implementation of classes and the adaptation logic

## The Concept

What if the Bee Movie wasn't a script, but a program? This project explores that question by building an object-oriented model of the movie's world—where bees are objects, the hive is a system, and the plot unfolds through class interactions and method calls.

**Status:** A work in progress built purely for fun and creative coding exploration.
